# Migration Guide

## v3.2.0 to v3.2.2

### Breaking Changes

#### `cn` split into `cn` and `cnMerge`

In v3.2.2, the `cn` function has been simplified to eliminate Proxy complexity. The function now returns a string directly with default twMerge config. For custom twMerge configuration, use the new `cnMerge` function.

**Before (v3.2.0 - v3.2.1):**
```ts
import { cn } from 'tailwind-variants';

// cn could be called with config (using Proxy)
cn('px-2', 'px-4')({ twMerge: false }); // => "px-2 px-4"
cn('px-2', 'px-4')(); // => "px-4" (with default config)
```

**After (v3.2.2+):**
```ts
import { cn, cnMerge } from 'tailwind-variants';

// cn now returns a string directly (no config support)
cn('px-2', 'px-4'); // => "px-4" (conflicts resolved with default config)

// cnMerge supports custom config via second function call
cnMerge('px-2', 'px-4')({ twMerge: false }); // => "px-2 px-4"
cnMerge('px-2', 'px-4')(); // => "px-4" (with default config)
```

**Migration:**
- If you were using `cn(...)` directly (most common case), no changes needed - it now works more intuitively by returning a string directly.
- If you were using `cn(...)(config)` or `cn(...)()`, migrate to `cnMerge`:
  ```ts
  // Before
  cn('px-2', 'px-4')({ twMerge: false });
  
  // After
  cnMerge('px-2', 'px-4')({ twMerge: false });
  ```

**Benefits:**
- Better TypeScript support (no Proxy types)
- Clearer API intent
- Better performance (no Proxy overhead)
- Easier maintenance

## v3.1.1 to v3.2.0

### New Features

#### Introduction of `cx` function

A new lightweight utility function `cx` has been added for concatenating class names without `tailwind-merge` conflict resolution. This is useful when you don't need automatic conflict resolution and want a smaller bundle size.

```ts
// v3.2.0+
import { cx, cn } from 'tailwind-variants';

// cx - no conflict resolution
cx('text-blue-500', 'text-red-500'); // => "text-blue-500 text-red-500"

// cn - with conflict resolution (original build)
cn('text-blue-500', 'text-red-500'); // => "text-red-500"
```

### Breaking Changes

#### `cnBase` should be replaced with `cx`

In v3.2.0+, `cnBase` should be replaced with the new `cx` function. The `cx` function provides the same functionality as `cnBase` (simple concatenation without conflict resolution) with a clearer name.

**Before (v3.1.1 and earlier):**
```ts
import { cnBase } from 'tailwind-variants';

// ...
{cnBase("flex items-center justify-center gap-2", className)}
```

**After (v3.2.0+):**
```ts
import { cx } from 'tailwind-variants';

// ...
{cx("flex items-center justify-center gap-2", className)}
```

**Migration:** Replace all instances of `cnBase` with `cx`. The API is identical - both functions combine class names without conflict resolution.

#### `cn` now defaults `twMerge` to `true`

In v3.2.0+, the `cn` function in the original build now defaults `twMerge` to `true` and uses `tailwind-merge` for conflict resolution. This means conflicting Tailwind classes will be automatically resolved.

**Before (v3.1.1 and earlier):**
```ts
cn('text-blue-500', 'text-red-500'); // => "text-blue-500 text-red-500" (both classes)
```

**After (v3.2.0+):**
```ts
cn('text-blue-500', 'text-red-500'); // => "text-red-500" (conflict resolved)
```

**Migration:** If you relied on `cn` not merging conflicts, you can:
1. Use the new `cx` function instead: `import { cx } from 'tailwind-variants'`
2. Or continue using `cn` if conflict resolution is desired (recommended)

#### `defaultConfig` exported as value

Starting in v3.2.0, `defaultConfig` is now exported as an actual value (not just a type), allowing direct import and modification:

```ts
// v3.2.0+
import { defaultConfig } from 'tailwind-variants';

defaultConfig.twMerge = false;
```

This enables easier global configuration management.

#### `responsiveVariants` removed

The `responsiveVariants` option has been removed. For more details, see the [Tailwind v4 documentation](/docs/tailwind-v4).

### Bug Fixes

- Code is no longer minified in the build output (improves debugging experience)

## v2 to v3

### Breaking Changes

#### Introduction of `/lite` entry point (no `tailwind-merge`)

In v3, `tailwind-variants` is now offered in two builds:

- **Original build** – includes `tailwind-merge` (same as before)
- **Lite build** – excludes `tailwind-merge` for a smaller bundle and faster runtime

##### What changed?

- `tailwind-merge` is no longer lazily loaded; it's statically included in the original build only
- Lite build completely removes `tailwind-merge` and its config
- `createTV`, `tv`, and `cn` in the lite build **no longer accept `config` (tailwind-merge config)**
- The `cn` utility (previously `cnBase`) is now exported from both builds with enhanced functionality

##### Migration Steps

If you use the default configuration with `twMerge: true` (conflict resolution enabled), make sure to install `tailwind-merge` in your project:

```bash
# npm
npm install tailwind-merge

# yarn
yarn add tailwind-merge

# pnpm
pnpm add tailwind-merge
```

If you do not need conflict resolution, switch to the lite build by importing from `tailwind-variants/lite`:

```ts
import {createTV, tv, cn, cnBase} from "tailwind-variants/lite";
```

#### Enhanced `cn` utility (formerly `cnBase`)

The `cn` utility has been significantly enhanced to support functionality similar to `classnames` / `clsx`. It now properly filters and handles various input types and formats the final result.

```ts
// v2
import {cnBase} from 'tailwind-variants';

// v3 - Original build (with tailwind-merge)
import {cn, cnBase} from 'tailwind-variants';

// v3 - Lite build (without tailwind-merge)
import {cn, cnBase} from 'tailwind-variants/lite';
```

Both `cn` and `cnBase` are exported for backwards compatibility, but `cn` is the recommended import.

### Performance Improvements

v3 includes significant performance improvements for projects using `tailwind-merge`:

| Test Case | v2 (ops/sec) | v3 (ops/sec) | Change |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| TV without slots & tw-merge | 1,397 | 572,465 | ⬆️ Up (~410x) |
| TV with slots & tw-merge | 692 | 306,297 | ⬆️ Up (~442x) |
| TV with custom tw-merge config | 700 | 359,269 | ⬆️ Up (~513x) |

> Note: Performance for the lite build (without tw-merge) may be slightly lower due to enhanced `cn` functionality, but this will be optimized in future updates.

### Bundle Size Comparison

- **Original build** (`tailwind-variants`): Includes `tailwind-merge` statically
- **Lite build** (`tailwind-variants/lite`): ~80% smaller without `tailwind-merge`

## v1 to v2

### Breaking Changes

#### tailwind-merge is now an optional peer dependency

In v2, we've made `tailwind-merge` an optional peer dependency to reduce bundle size for users who don't need Tailwind CSS conflict resolution.

##### What changed?

- `tailwind-merge` is no longer bundled with tailwind-variants
- Users who want conflict resolution must install it separately
- Users who don't need conflict resolution can save ~3KB in bundle size

##### Migration Steps

If you use the default configuration with `twMerge: true` (conflict resolution enabled):

```bash
# npm
npm install tailwind-merge

# yarn
yarn add tailwind-merge

# pnpm
pnpm add tailwind-merge
```

If you don't need conflict resolution, disable it in your config:

```js
const button = tv(
  {
    base: "px-4 py-2 rounded",
    variants: {
      color: {
        primary: "bg-blue-500 text-white",
        secondary: "bg-gray-500 text-white",
      },
    },
  },
  {
    twMerge: false, // Disable conflict resolution
  },
);
```

### Performance Improvements

v2 also includes significant performance optimizations:

- **37-62% faster** for most operations
- Optimized object creation and array operations
- Reduced function call overhead
- Better memory usage

All existing APIs remain the same, so no code changes are required beyond the tailwind-merge installation.
